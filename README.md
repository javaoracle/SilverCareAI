# SilverCareAI
We use Raspberry Pi and a simple camera module to monitor the poses of the elderly and, through this, to recognize falls and emergencies. By making an optimized model and making a model that runs on inexpensive hardware, we want to help care for many elderly people, especially the elderly living alone.
